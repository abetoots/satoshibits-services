# Documentation Principles: Preventing Code Drift

**Date**: 2025-10-08
**Context**: Principles established through analysis with Gemini Pro to prevent documentation drift

## The Problem

Documentation that duplicates code structure inevitably drifts from reality:
- **API examples** show methods that don't exist (`BullMQProvider.factory()`)
- **Interface definitions** copied into docs become outdated
- **Type signatures** manually maintained fall out of sync
- **Configuration options** documented exhaustively require constant updates

**Result**: Users encounter code that doesn't work, support burden increases, trust erodes.

## Core Principles

### 1. The Source is the Truth

**TypeScript source files are the ultimate authority** on API signatures, configuration interfaces, and types.

**‚úÖ DO:**
- Link directly to source files for complete API reference
- Use comments like: `// See BullMQProviderConfig in src/providers/bullmq/bullmq.provider.mts`
- Trust the code, not the docs, when there's conflict

**‚ùå DON'T:**
- Copy interface definitions into documentation
- Manually maintain type signatures in markdown
- Duplicate method signatures from implementation

**Example - Before (will drift):**
```markdown
### BullMQProviderConfig

```typescript
interface BullMQProviderConfig {
  connection: ConnectionOptions;
  prefix?: string;
  defaultJobOptions?: {
    attempts?: number;
    backoff?: {
      type: "exponential" | "fixed";
      delay: number;
    };
    removeOnComplete?: boolean | number;
    removeOnFail?: boolean | number;
  };
  healthErrorRateThreshold?: number;
}
```
```

**Example - After (resilient):**
```markdown
### BullMQProvider Configuration

```typescript
const provider = new BullMQProvider({
  connection: {
    host: 'localhost',
    port: 6379
  }
  // For full configuration options, see BullMQProviderConfig
  // in src/providers/bullmq/bullmq.provider.mts
});
```
```

### 2. Document for the Consumer

**README is for users** of the library. Focus on *how to use it*, not *how it works*.

**Consumer Needs:**
- How do I get started?
- What are common use cases?
- How do I solve specific problems?
- Where can I find complete details?

**Contributor Needs (ARCHITECTURE.md):**
- Why was it designed this way?
- What are the trade-offs?
- How do components interact?
- What are the invariants?

**‚úÖ DO:**
- Show realistic, minimal working examples
- Explain concepts and patterns
- Link to source for exhaustive details
- Focus on the "what" and "why" over the "how"

**‚ùå DON'T:**
- Document internal implementation details in README
- Copy every config option into consumer docs
- Explain architecture decisions in quick-start guides
- Duplicate information between README and ARCHITECTURE

### 3. Examples are Executable Contracts

**Every code example is a promise** to your user that "this works."

**‚úÖ DO:**
- Keep examples minimal but complete
- Test examples or extract them from tests
- Update examples when APIs change
- Prefer real-world scenarios over toy examples

**‚ùå DON'T:**
- Use fictional methods or APIs
- Show incomplete examples that won't compile
- Include commented-out "variations" that confuse
- Create examples you haven't actually run

**Testing Strategy:**
```typescript
// Good: Example is literally from your test suite
// test/examples/readme-quickstart.test.ts
it('matches README quick start example', async () => {
  // This code block is copied directly to README
  const queue = new Queue('emails');
  await queue.add('send-welcome', { userId: 123 });
  // ...
});
```

### 4. Show, Don't Just Tell

**A well-chosen example is more instructive than an exhaustive list.**

**‚úÖ DO:**
- Show common configuration patterns in code blocks
- Use realistic use cases in examples
- Demonstrate best practices implicitly
- Let code speak for itself

**‚ùå DON'T:**
- Create tables of every possible option
- Write prose descriptions when code is clearer
- Explain what the code obviously does
- Duplicate information from JSDoc

**Example - Before (exhaustive, will drift):**
```markdown
### Worker Options

- `concurrency`: number - Max concurrent jobs (default: 1)
- `batchSize`: number - Jobs per fetch (default: 1)
- `pollInterval`: number - Milliseconds between polls (default: 100)
- `errorBackoff`: number - Wait after error (default: 1000)
- `provider`: IQueueProvider - Queue provider instance (required)
- `maxJobSize`: number - Max job payload bytes (default: undefined)
- ... (12 more options)
```

**Example - After (practical, resilient):**
```markdown
### Worker Options

```typescript
const worker = new Worker('emails', handler, {
  provider: myProvider,
  concurrency: 10,
  batchSize: 5
});
```

For all available options, see the `WorkerOptions` interface in `src/api/worker.mts`.
```

## Practical Guidelines

### For README.md

**Target Audience**: Library consumers, developers integrating the library

**Include:**
- Installation instructions
- Quick start with minimal example
- Common patterns and use cases
- Troubleshooting common mistakes
- Links to source for detailed config

**Exclude:**
- Internal implementation details
- Complete interface definitions
- Architecture rationale
- Provider implementation specifics

**Structure:**
```markdown
1. What/Why (value proposition)
2. Quick Start (minimal working example)
3. Core Concepts (how to think about it)
4. Common Patterns (real-world usage)
5. Configuration Reference (minimal + link to source)
6. Links to ARCHITECTURE.md for deep dives
```

### For ARCHITECTURE.md

**Target Audience**: Contributors, maintainers, architects evaluating the library

**Include:**
- Design principles and rationale
- Trade-offs and alternatives considered
- Component interactions and boundaries
- Invariants and constraints
- Extension points
- Links to specific implementation files

**Exclude:**
- API usage examples (that's README)
- Installation/quick-start (that's README)
- Complete interface dumps (that's source)
- Step-by-step tutorials (that's README)

**Structure:**
```markdown
1. Philosophy (why it exists, what problems it solves)
2. Architecture Overview (high-level components)
3. Design Decisions (trade-offs, alternatives)
4. Key Abstractions (provider interface, job lifecycle)
5. Extension Points (how to add providers)
6. Constraints and Invariants (what must remain true)
```

### Linking Strategy

**Link to source** for exhaustive details:
```markdown
For complete configuration options, see:
- `BullMQProviderConfig` in `src/providers/bullmq/bullmq.provider.mts`
- `WorkerOptions` in `src/api/worker.mts`
```

**Link to ARCHITECTURE.md** for design rationale:
```markdown
Why do we use Result types? See [Error Handling](./ARCHITECTURE.md#error-handling).
```

**Link to examples/** for complex scenarios:
```markdown
See [Production Setup Example](./examples/production-setup/) for a complete runnable demonstration.
```

## Code Example Template

```typescript
// Good example structure:

// 1. Minimal imports
import { Queue, Worker } from '@satoshibits/queue';
import { BullMQProvider } from '@satoshibits/queue/providers/bullmq';

// 2. Show the actual API (not fictional)
const provider = new BullMQProvider({
  connection: { host: 'localhost', port: 6379 }
  // Comment pointing to source for full config
});

// 3. Realistic use case
const queue = new Queue('emails', {
  provider: provider.forQueue('emails')
});

// 4. No commented-out variations
await queue.add('send-welcome', { userId: 123 });
```

## Red Flags: When Documentation Will Drift

üö© **Copied interface definition** - Will diverge from source
üö© **Exhaustive option table** - Will become incomplete
üö© **Method signature in prose** - Will change in implementation
üö© **Multiple examples of same pattern** - Hard to keep consistent
üö© **Commented-out code** - Confusing, likely outdated
üö© **"Coming soon" features** - Never updated when implemented
üö© **Inline type definitions** - Duplicates source of truth

## Maintenance Workflow

### When Adding a Feature

1. ‚úÖ Implement feature with tests
2. ‚úÖ Add ONE minimal example to README (if user-facing)
3. ‚úÖ Document design decision in ARCHITECTURE.md (if significant)
4. ‚úÖ Link to source for complete details
5. ‚ùå Don't copy interface definition to docs
6. ‚ùå Don't create exhaustive option tables

### When Changing an API

1. ‚úÖ Update implementation and tests
2. ‚úÖ Search docs for code examples using old API
3. ‚úÖ Update examples to use new API
4. ‚úÖ Verify links to source files are still correct
5. ‚ùå Don't need to update interface docs (they link to source)

### During Code Review

**Check for:**
- [ ] Examples match actual implementation
- [ ] No copied interfaces or type definitions
- [ ] Links to source for complete details
- [ ] Examples are minimal and realistic
- [ ] ARCHITECTURE.md has design rationale, not usage
- [ ] README has usage, not implementation details

## Summary: Quick Reference

| Aspect | ‚úÖ DO | ‚ùå DON'T |
|--------|-------|----------|
| **API Reference** | Link to source files | Copy interface definitions |
| **Examples** | Minimal, tested, realistic | Exhaustive, fictional, complex |
| **Config Options** | Show common cases + link | List every option in table |
| **Design Rationale** | ARCHITECTURE.md | README.md |
| **Usage Patterns** | README.md | ARCHITECTURE.md |
| **Type Signatures** | Let TypeScript provide them | Maintain in docs manually |
| **Complete Details** | Point to source | Duplicate in markdown |

## Application Checklist for ARCHITECTURE.md

When updating ARCHITECTURE.md, ensure:

- [ ] Focus on **why** decisions were made, not **how** to use the API
- [ ] Explain **trade-offs** and alternatives considered
- [ ] Document **invariants** that must be maintained
- [ ] Link to **specific implementation files** for examples
- [ ] Avoid duplicating **interface definitions** (link to source)
- [ ] Keep **component diagrams** conceptual, not exhaustive
- [ ] Document **extension points** for contributors
- [ ] Reference **specific commits/PRs** for historical context when relevant
- [ ] Distinguish between **philosophy** (timeless) and **implementation** (may change)

---

**Remember**: Documentation should be a **map**, not a **duplicate** of the territory. Maps can be simple and still be accurate. Duplicates will always drift.
