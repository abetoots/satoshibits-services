# Functional Library

A comprehensive collection of functional programming utilities for TypeScript, designed to promote immutability, composability, and type safety.

## Overview

This library provides a set of pure, composable functions that follow functional programming principles. All utilities are designed to be tree-shakeable, type-safe, and optimized for performance.

## Architecture Principles

- **Pure Functions**: All utilities are pure functions with no side effects
- **Immutability**: Functions never mutate input data, always returning new values
- **Composability**: Designed to work together through function composition
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with comprehensive type inference
- **Tree-Shaking**: No barrel exports - import directly from specific modules
- **Performance**: Optimized implementations with minimal overhead

## Modules

Each module exposes its own "For Dummies" primer and decision tree at the very top of the source file. Treat those JSDoc blocks as the single source of truthâ€”they are updated alongside the implementation and explain how to choose between related helpers.

- [`array-utils.mts`](./src/array-utils.mts) â€“ Immutable array helpers.
- [`object-utils.mts`](./src/object-utils.mts) â€“ Copy-on-write object transforms.
- [`composition.mts`](./src/composition.mts) â€“ `pipe`, `flow`, `compose`, and friends.
- [`predicates.mts`](./src/predicates.mts) â€“ Predicate combinators and batteries-included checks.
- [`performance.mts`](./src/performance.mts) â€“ Debounce/throttle/batching utilities plus timing helpers.
- [`pipeline.mts`](./src/pipeline.mts) â€“ Chainable class wrapper over composition patterns.
- [`result.mts`](./src/result.mts) â€“ Explicit success/error container utilities.
- [`reader.mts`](./src/reader.mts) & [`reader-result.mts`](./src/reader-result.mts) â€“ Dependency injection-friendly monads.
- [`task.mts`](./src/task.mts) â€“ Lazy async computations.
- [`option.mts`](./src/option.mts) â€“ Maybe-style optional handling.
- [`types.mts`](./src/types.mts) â€“ Branded/nominal type helpers.
- [`validation.mts`](./src/validation.mts) â€“ Result-powered validation DSL.

> ðŸ“Œ Tip: when in doubt, open the module and read the lead JSDocâ€”it includes simple explanations, usage guidance, and decision trees that stay in sync with the code.

## Usage Patterns

### Import Strategy

Prefer targeted subpath imports so bundlers only touch the code you need. The root export still works and is now marked `sideEffects: false`, so unused utilities are tree-shaken either way.

```typescript
// Focused imports keep bundles lean
import { pipe, compose } from "@satoshibits/functional/composition";
import { mapValues, pick } from "@satoshibits/functional/object-utils";

// Root import stays available; bundlers will drop unused exports
import { Result } from "@satoshibits/functional";
```

### Composition Patterns

Functions are designed to work together through composition:

```typescript
import { chunk, filterMap } from "@satoshibits/functional/array-utils";
import { pipe } from "@satoshibits/functional/composition";
import { isNotNil } from "@satoshibits/functional/predicates";

// Combine utilities for complex transformations
const processData = pipe(
  filterMap((x: unknown) => (isNotNil(x) ? x : undefined)),
  chunk(10),
);
```

### Error Handling

Use Result types for explicit error handling:

```typescript
import { findSafe } from "@satoshibits/functional/array-utils";
import { Result } from "@satoshibits/functional";

// Functions return Result types for safety
const result = findSafe((x: User) => x.id === targetId)(users);

if (result.success) {
  console.log("Found user:", result.data);
} else {
  console.log("User not found");
}
```

## Testing

All utilities have comprehensive test suites. Run tests with:

```bash
# Run all functional library tests
pnpm test src/lib/functional

# Run specific module tests
pnpm test src/lib/functional/array-utils.test.ts
```

## Performance Considerations

- **Memory Efficiency**: Functions like `filterMap` avoid intermediate arrays
- **Lazy Evaluation**: Pipeline class enables lazy transformation chains
- **Memoization**: Use `memoize` for expensive pure computations
- **Batching**: `batchAsync` optimizes concurrent async operations

## Migration Guide

If migrating from the old structure:

1. Replace imports from `pipe.mts` with `composition.mts`
2. Import array/object utilities from their dedicated modules
3. Remove any imports from `index.mts` (barrel file removed)
4. Update type imports for Result and ValidationError

## Contributing

When adding new utilities:

1. Ensure functions are pure with no side effects
2. Add comprehensive JSDoc with `@example` blocks
3. Include proper `@since` tags with current date
4. Write thorough unit tests
5. Follow established naming conventions
6. Refresh the module's lead JSDoc so the "For Dummies" + decision tree guidance stays accurate
